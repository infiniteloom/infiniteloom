As a software engineer with a background in music and fine arts, I view every project through an inspired lens. My experiences as a freelance creative and bandleader have taught me to hold myself accountable, encouraging me to grow a strong skillset around organization, time management and communications. I am an independent thinker who welcomes collaboration on the path to achieving creative solutions to complex problems.

Trained as a full-stack engineer, I'm most interested in front-end development, design and programming with UX/UI in mind.
